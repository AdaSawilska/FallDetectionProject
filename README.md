# Fall Detection Classification Project

This project aims to solve a supervised learning classification problem with time series taken from accelerometers. The data are signals in 3 axes collected form people performing different activities like walking, falling, running jumping or taking the stairs.  As the time series are different length and have different sampling frequency it is not possible to solve this problem straightforward giving the data to classification algorithm. The signal have to be preproccesed and some crucial parameters have to be extracted to feed them to the classifier. 

The dataset used in this project comes from the IFMBE Scientific Challenge Competition of the
16th Mediterranean Conference on Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing (MEDI-
CONâ€™23). The dataset consists of accelerometer data from 16 young subjects performing 12 activ-
ities of daily living (ADL) and 3 types of simulated falls. The subjects were wearing an inertial
sensor unit (Shimmer sensing, Ireland) attached to their waist to record the activities.

The data is taken from a website of the [Sci-challenge]( https://sci-challenge.ifmbe.org/):
