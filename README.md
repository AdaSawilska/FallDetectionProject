# Fall Detection Classification Project

The dataset used in this project comes from the IFMBE  [Scientific Challenge Competition](https://sci-challenge.ifmbe.org/) of the
16th Mediterranean Conference on Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing (MEDI-CONâ€™23). The dataset consists of accelerometer data from 16 young subjects performing 12 activities of daily living and 3 types of simulated falls. The subjects were wearing an inertial sensor unit attached to their waist to record the activities. This project aims to solve a supervised learning classification problem with time series taken from accelerometers. The data are time series in 3 axes collected form people performing different activities like walking, falling, running jumping or taking the stairs.
