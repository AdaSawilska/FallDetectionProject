# Fall Detection Classification Project

The dataset used in this project comes from the IFMBE  [Scientific Challenge Competition](https://sci-challenge.ifmbe.org/) of the
16th Mediterranean Conference on Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing (MEDI-
CONâ€™23). The dataset consists of accelerometer data from 16 young subjects performing 12 activ-
ities of daily living (ADL) and 3 types of simulated falls. The subjects were wearing an inertial
sensor unit (Shimmer sensing, Ireland) attached to their waist to record the activities.
